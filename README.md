# OOP-Assignment-wk5
# OOP Assignment 🏗️

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Python.  
It contains two activities:  

## Assignment 1: Custom Class
- Created a `Smartphone` class with attributes and methods.  
- Added a subclass `GamingSmartphone` to show **inheritance** and **polymorphism**.  
- Demonstrates constructors, method overriding, and encapsulation.  

## Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- Created a base class `Vehicle` with a common method `move()`.  
- Subclasses (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`) each implement `move()` differently.  
- Demonstrates **polymorphism** in action.  

## How to Run
1. Save the code in a Python file (e.g., `oop_assignment.py`).  
2. Run in terminal:  
   ```bash
   python oop_assignment.py
